Plethora is a block-based puzzle game created in Adobe Flash.
This was a final project for Flash Programming, a course taught by Professor
Nathan Hull at NYU, Fall 2010.

A detailed description of the directories and their content is coming soon.

For now, to download an executable copy of the game, download plethora_final.swf
and Music/anathema.mp3.

Object of the game:  Reach the top of the gold block, by pushing other blocks and jumping
on top of them.  Each block has a special attribute so push them to figure out how they work!
Be careful not to fall into traps or to let a block fall on top of you though.  If that happens, you'll
have to restart the level.  Good luck.

Controls:
   LEFT ARROW KEY - move left
   RIGHT ARROW KEY - move right
   SPACEBAR KEY - jump
   R KEY - reset a level

Future Plans:
   Incorporate smoother controls
   More animations
   Soundtrack
   Variety of puzzles
   Cleaner algorithms
   Publish the game!
